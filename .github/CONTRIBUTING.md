[![Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-join-cf0e5b.svg?style=flat-square)](https://now-examples-slackin-stlpermtzi.now.sh)

All kinds of contributions (enhancements, features, documentation & code improvements, bugs reporting) are welcome.

## Code style ##

### Javascript

We use [ESLint](http://eslint.org) based on Google code style to maintain code style.  
Check code status with :
``` bash
npm run lint
```

## Pull requests ##

All pull requests must be done on the **dev** branch.

Before a pull request :

 - There is no tests yet so verify that your code is running well. Blog generation (`hexo g`) must not outputs errors
 - Check code style with eslint.
 - Don't forget to update the documentation if it's necessary
