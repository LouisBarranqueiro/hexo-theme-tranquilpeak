# I STRONGLY recommend you to use a CDN to speed up loading of pages.
# There is many free CDN like Cloudinary or you can also use indirectly
# by using services like Google Photos.

# If you want to store images yourself, please read this guidelines:
# For users, if you only use this theme, put your images directly in `source/assets/images` folder
# But if you want to add local images, you can put your images directly in `source/assets/images` folder
# For developpers, if you modify this theme, put your images in `source/_images` folder and
# use grunt task `build` to synchronize assets


# Image directory (default: images)
image_dir: assets/images

# Sidebar Configuration
# ---------------------

#    You can add groups of links and links much as you want
#    You just have to respect the indentation : `groups of links` -> `link` -> `title, link, icon`
#    E.g:
#    -------------
#    sidebar:                   # DON'T modify this variable name
#         menu:                 # Name of your groups of links (changeable)
#             home:             # Name of your link (changeable)
#                title: Home    # Title of your link displayed
#                url: /         # URL of the link. If the URL is internal, domain name is not necessary
#                icon: home     # CSS class names of the Font Awesome icon
#                               # Go to https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free to find icons you want
